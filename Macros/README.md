MY MACROS FUNCTIONALITY DEPENDS ON THIS, without this it won't work lmao

## Shear Arcs (rinHShearArcs)
Macro to shear arcs in XY direction. Usage instructions:
1. First, Select note range with arcs you want to shear. (this can actually be done later, but I recommend doing it at this stage)
2. Then, run the macro and choose the shear easing to your liking.
3. Press the enter key immediately if you have selected your notes via step 1. Otherwise, you have to select notes manually, and then press the enter key.
4. Select two points, first grid is at the start of first selected arc, this will be the center of the start position. The other point selection grid is at the end of the last arc. This will be the center of the end position after the arc is sheared.
5. wow!
